## 0.0.4

BREAKING CHANGE: Fixed the `Darin` widget only accepting a child, now it accepts a `WidgetBuilder` instead, because a `BuildContext` is required to actually use the new scope.

## 0.0.3

Added support for injecting providers of scopes too.

## 0.0.2

Added support for provider injection (lazy dependencies).

## 0.0.1

Initial release with support for:

- Inherited Darin widget
- All Darin 0.0.1 features
